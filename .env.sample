.env.sample
This file contains environment variables for configuring the Stremio TamilShows Addon.
Copy this file to '.env' and fill in the values.
Remember: For production deployments (e.g., Docker Hub), these variables
should be set directly in your Docker Compose file or Kubernetes deployment,
and sensitive values like Docker Hub credentials should be managed as secrets.
--- Core Addon Configuration ---
Initial RSS Feed URL for the TamilShows content.
This URL will be used to fetch content. The addon will dynamically update this
if the domain changes, by consulting the MASTER_DOMAIN.
Example: RSS_FEED_URL_INITIAL=https://www.1tamilblasters.fi/index.php?/forums/forum/63-tamil-new-web-series-tv-shows.xml/

RSS_FEED_URL_INITIAL=
Master Domain for redirection checks.
This domain will be visited periodically to find the current active domain for the RSS feed,
in case the primary RSS_FEED_URL_INITIAL becomes unreachable or returns no content.
Example: MASTER_DOMAIN=http://1tamilblasters.net/

MASTER_DOMAIN=http://1tamilblasters.net/
--- Redis Database Configuration ---
Hostname or IP address of the Redis server.

REDIS_HOST=redis
Port number for the Redis server.

REDIS_PORT=6379
Redis database number to use (0-15 by default).

REDIS_DB=0
--- Scheduling Intervals (in hours) ---
Interval at which the RSS feed will be fetched and the catalog updated (in hours).
Example: FETCH_INTERVAL_HOURS=3 (fetches every 3 hours)

FETCH_INTERVAL_HOURS=3
Interval at which the addon will check the MASTER_DOMAIN for a potential RSS feed domain change (in hours).
Example: DOMAIN_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS=24 (checks every 24 hours)

DOMAIN_CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS=24
--- Data Retention ---
Deletes catalog entries and their associated streams older than this many years from the current year.
Example: DELETE_OLDER_THAN_YEARS=2 (removes content older than (current_year - 2) years)

DELETE_OLDER_THAN_YEARS=2
--- Torrent Trackers ---
URL to fetch a list of reliable torrent trackers. These will be appended to magnet URIs.
Example: TRACKERS_URL=https://ngosang.github.io/trackerslist/trackers_all.txt

TRACKERS_URL=https://ngosang.github.io/trackerslist/trackers_all.txt
--- Logging Configuration ---
Logging level for the application.
Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
Set to 'DEBUG' for verbose output (useful for development and troubleshooting).
Set to 'INFO' for standard operational messages (good for production).
Set to 'ERROR' for only critical errors.

LOG_LEVEL=INFO
--- Cache Management ---
Set to 'true' or '1' to clear ONLY the application's specific data (catalog and streams)
from Redis on every application startup.
Set to 'false' or '0' (default) to keep existing cached data and only add/update new content.
Use this when you want to force a full re-ingestion of content.

CLEAR_REDIS_ON_STARTUP=false
